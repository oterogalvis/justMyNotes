	@import
		Allow us to import from the header or another css file. Example: @import "import-styles.css"
	Universal selector
		* {}
	id selector
		Target sigle element. Example: <p id="bla"></p> === #bla { border: 3px solid red; }
	class selector
		Target multiple elements. Example: <p class="bla"></p> === .bla { border: 3px solid red; }
	Decendent selector
		Target an element iside a element. Example: .main-header span { color: white; }
	pseudo classes
		Can target elements dynamically based on user interaction, an elementâ€™s state, and more. like :link :focus, or :hover.
	TIP:
		For keys like with you can use values like % datatype.
		Set margins to be equals and take the same width. margin: auto;
		Is ok to use the universal selector for box-sizing: border-box;
	em
		Relative length units are relative to other length values. The most commonly used relative unit is the em unit. The em is known as a font-relative unit because it's calculated based on a parent element's font size.
	rem
		The rem unit is similar to the em unit. The difference is that rem is relative only to the root element of the page. This gets us around the compounding font size issue we experience with em units.
	rgb
		Assign color with RGB values, also possible to add transparency. 
		Example: color: rgb(255, 169, 73)  ||  rgba(255, 169, 73, .4)
	generic fonts
		serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, fantasy. When assigning a font family is a good practice to assign a generic font at the end as last resource. 
		Example: font-family: "Helvetica Neue" Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
