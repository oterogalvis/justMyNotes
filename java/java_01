	Getters
		To get a private member.

	Setters
		You use a setter when you want to change the value of a field, after the object has been created.
		public void setName(String newName){ mName = newName;}
	Constructor(initialize)
		A constructor initialises an instance variable inside a class once a class is instantiated using the "new" Keyword.
		public ClassName(String newName){ mName = newName;}
	main(String[] args)
		The main class should have a main method which calls another classes, the classe that are not main should have a method with the same name that the class. The main method should be define as: public static void.
	args[0]
		A class can use the args[0] as the variable iside its method to use the first object in the array call args that is set when the program is executed.
	Array()
		List of elements.
	Types of variables
		Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields):
			Instance variables belong to an instance of a class. Another way of saying that is instance variables belong to an object, since an object is an instance of a class. Every object has it’s own copy of the instance variables. 
		Class Variables (Static Fields):
			Is any field declared with the static modifier; this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated.
		Local Variables:
			Variable that’s declared within the body of a method. Then you can use the variable only within that method. You can not use any kind of accessor (public, protected or private).
		Parameters:
Example: "./Example_06.java"
	TIP
		== is only for primitives (It can work with strings because the compiler create a single instance and makes all variables refer to the same instance, and keep all these variables in the "string pool", unless it's created using the constructor).
		equals() is only for objects.
	binary 
		10101011 = 0 2 4 6 8 16 32 64
		With 8 bits(== 1 byte), you can store just about any character (char) char A == 97, and char B is 98. 1024 bytes is 1KB, 1024 kilobytes is 1MB...
	packages
		Help us to make sure that our class names are distinguishable.
	reversed internet domain name
		Example: teamtreehouse.com => com.teamtreehouse
	%n
		Is new line in any operative system, is equal to \n in linux and \r in windows.
	immutable
		When an object cannot be changed, it is often referred to as, immutable.
	date
		Use date attributes and methods. Import java.util.Date.
	epoch time
		Number of milliseconds since January 1st, 1970.
	inheritance
		A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class). By doing that the child class inherit the public fields and the methods.
	TIP
		All the classes in Java inherit from a special type call object.
		\" use in order to print a quote inside a string.
	toString()
		Is an Object superclass method. In general, the toString method returns a string that texturally represents this object.
	@Override
		An annotation is used to help the compiler, at compile time, understand that you're intending to override a method that exist in the parent class. 
	typecasting
		Switching of a variable between types is called type conversion or type coercion or most commonly known as typecasting.
			Upcast. parentObject store a childObject:
				ParentClass parentObject = childObject
			Downcast. childObject store a parentObject:
				ChildClass childObject = (ChildClass) parentObject
			Create an array of objects:
				Object[] differentObjects = [instanceOfOne, instanceOfTwo]
			Cast elements from differentObjects array:
				((ClassOne) differentObjects[0]); => VALID: differentObjects[0] == instanceOfOne
				((ClassOne) differentObjects[1]); => INVALID: instanceOfTwo is not an instance of ClassOne.
			We neet to use 'instanceof' method before performing a downcast to avoid runtime errors:
				differentObjects[0] instanceof ClassOne => True
	instanceof
		Method return a boolean if the instance below to the sugested class.
Example: "./Example_07.java"
	.split()
		Split an String into an Array.
	Method chain
		Methods followed by others. oneSentence.toLowerCase().contains("words");
	TIP
		The length of an array is set at creation time, and is inmutable. We can change the value but we can't change the length of the array.
	compareTo()
		Method use to compare two items. if t > o => 1. if t < o => -1. if t = o => 0.
	Serialization
		Is the process of translating objects into a format that can be stored and recreated later in the same or different environment.
	import java.io.*;
		If we are going to use a bunch of imports from the java.io package we can simply put a star here and it will import everything that we need.
	deserialization
		The process of opening that object again at a later time, or even giving it to someone else for them to open up.
	serialver
		Program use to generate a code that will be use in the java class in order to avoid class incompatibility. Class incompatibility happen when you deserialize a instance wicth class was modify. 
		Example: serialver com.teamtreehouse.Example_07_package
Example: "./Example_08.java" & "./Example_08.java"
	JCF (Java Collections Framework)
		Grouping of tools in charge of storage and retrieval of data efficiency.
	Big O Notation
		Is the language we use for articulating how long an algorithm takes to run. It's how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem.
	Generics
		It would be nice if we could write a single sort method that could sort the elements in an Integer array, a String array, or an array of any type that supports ordering.
		Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify, with a single method declaration, a set of related methods, or with a single class declaration, a set of related types, respectively.
		Generics also provide compile-time type safety that allows programmers to catch invalid types at compile time.
		Example: <T>
	Collection<T>
		Collection of a generics(T), in the example "Collection<String>" this is a collection of Strings.
		When we implement the Comparable interface, the compareTo() method will take and object as variable, and then we need to cast the another object we want to compare into a Object class in order to avoid incompatibility between classes. Now if we implement Comparable<DesiredClass> there is no need to cast an object into a different class becouse the compareTo() method will take a DesiredClass instance.
	TIP
		Never copy and paste code, always make a method compatible with similar purposes.
		Check examples to see how to
	Sets (java.util.Set)
		This interface works similar than a List, Set(HashSet) does not allow duplicates. When use Tree(TreeSet) the elemens are also unique and organize in alphabetical order.
	Maps (java.util.Map)
		Map provides a key value representation of data. Maps can be used for all sorts of applications, from counting to indexing.
	Iterate through a HashMap
	    for (String key : map.keySet()) { // ... }
	    for (Object value : map.values()) { // ... }
Example: "./Example_09.java"
