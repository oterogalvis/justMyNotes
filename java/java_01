	java 
		To execute code.
	//
		To comment.
	;

		The first letter is lowercase and the second capitalize. Example: firstName
Example: "./example_00.java"
	printf
		Print formatted text. Use variables and special formatting instructions.
	%s
		Alloy string replacement. Example: "Hello, I'm %s", firstName
	TIP
		First declare a variable using it's data type, like String.
		Then the set the variable un CamelCase.

		Change to lowercase.
	.println()
		Print a line with a \n at the end. Likes puts in ruby.
Example: "./example_03.java"
	TIP
		Constans in uppercase.
	final keyword
		Final keyword make sure no one can change the value.
	static keyword
		Make a value accessible right of the class.
	void keyword
		It's assign to a method that return nothing.
	TIP
		To make a method that acept 0 to 1 argument you create two methods with the same name.
	exceptions
		To tell the user if there is any problem using our object.
	throw keyword
		To throw a exception.
	try - catch keyword
		To catch a exception.
	iae.getMessage()
		iea => IllegalArgumentException. Get the exception message.
Example: "./example_04.java"
	Separation of concerns
		Separate the displaying portion of the code from the mage state and the behavior code.
	TIP
		"" are for strings 
		'' are for char(characters)
		You can sum stings.
	indexOf()
		Return the index of a specific char. If char not include in string return -1.
	charAt()
		Return the char of a specific index.
	length()
		Tell you how many chars are in the string.
	%d
		Alloy decimal replacement. Example: "The number is %d", getNumber()
	TIP
		Always limite your scope to the story you are working on.
	toCharArray();
		Breaks the string into an array of chars.
	forEachloop
		Loop over arrays.
		for (char letter : example.toCharArray()){}
Example: "./Example_05.java"
	isLetter(x)
		Method that verify if the char 'x' is a letter. This method belong to the Character Wrapper.
	toLowerCase(x)
		Change a upcase letter to lowercase. This method belong to the Character Wrapper.
	toUpperCase(x)
		Change a lowercase letter to uppercase. This method belong to the Character Wrapper.
	isLowerCase(x)
		Returns true if the char is lowercase. This method belong to the Character Wrapper.
	isUpperCase(x)
		Returns true if the char is uppercase. This method belong to the Character Wrapper.
	TIP
		While loop using booleans and exceptions. Check Example_06_prompter.java
	Getters
		To get a private member.
		public String getName(){ return mName;}
	Setters
		You use a setter when you want to change the value of a field, after the object has been created.
		public void setName(String newName){ mName = newName;}
	Constructor
		A constructor initialises an instance variable inside a class once a class is instantiated using the "new" Keyword.
		public ClassName(String newName){ mName = newName;}
	main(String[] args)
		The main class should have a main method which calls another classes, the classe that are not main should have a method with the same name that the class. The main method should be define as: public static void.
	args[0]
		A class can use the args[0] as the variable iside its method to use the first object in the array call args that is set when the program is executed.
	Array()
		List of elements.
Example: "./Example_06.java"
	TIP
		== is only for primitives (It can work with strings because the compiler create a single instance and makes all variables refer to the same instance, and keep all these variables in the "string pool", unless it's created using the constructor).
		equals() is only for objects.
	binary 
		10101011 = 0 2 4 6 8 16 32 64
		With 8 bits(== 1 byte), you can store just about any character (char) char A == 97, and char B is 98. 1024 bytes is 1KB, 1024 kilobytes is 1MB...
	packages
		Help us to make sure that our class names are distinguishable.
	%n
		Is new line in any operative system, is equal to \n in linux and \r in windows.
	immutable
		When an object cannot be changed, it is often referred to as, immutable.
	date
		Use date attributes and methods. Import java.util.Date.
	epoch time
		Number of milliseconds since January 1st, 1970.
	inheritance
		A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class). By doing that the child class inherit the public fields and the methods.
	TIP
		All the classes in Java inherit from a special type call object.
	toString()
		Is an Object superclass method. In general, the toString method returns a string that texturally represents this object.
	@Override
		An annotation is used to help the compiler, at compile time, understand that you're intending to override a method that exist in the parent class. 
	typecasting
		Switching of a variable between types is called type conversion or type coercion or most commonly known as typecasting.
			Upcast. parentObject store a childObject:
				ParentClass parentObject = childObject
			Downcast. childObject store a parentObject:
				ChildClass childObject = (ChildClass) parentObject
			Create an array of objects:
				Object[] differentObjects = [instanceOfOne, instanceOfTwo]
			Cast elements from differentObjects array:
				((ClassOne) differentObjects[0]); => VALID: differentObjects[0] == instanceOfOne
				((ClassOne) differentObjects[1]); => INVALID: instanceOfTwo is not an instance of ClassOne.
			We neet to use 'instanceof' method before performing a downcast to avoid runtime errors:
				differentObjects[0] instanceof ClassOne => True
	instanceof
		Method return a boolean if the instance below to the sugested class.
