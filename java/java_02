	Ternary operator
		ThisIsTrue ? ThisHappen : OtherwiseThisHappen
	Unit
		The smallest testable part of an application
	Polymorphism
		Is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
	Inheritance and Composition
		Inheritance is an "is-a" relationship. Composition is a "has-a". You do composition by having an instance of another class 'C' as a field of your class, instead of extending 'C'.
		Example: Car has a Engine and Car is a Automobile
			class Engine {} // The engine class.
			class Automobile{} // Automobile class which is parent to Car class.
			// Car is an Automobile, so Car class extends Automobile class.
			class Car extends Automobile{ 
			 // Car has a Engine so, Car class has an instance of Engine class as its member.
			 private Engine engine; 
			}
	Single Responsibility Principle
		Every class should have responsibility over a single par ot functionality provided by the software.
		A class should only have one reason to change.
	Test-Driven Development (TDD)
		As the name implies, it places emphasis on the need to test every unit of code (even before the code is written) before full development can begin. You start by testing for a functionality (which fails), then you write just enough code to ensure the test passes. You then test the code and make corrections where necessary until the test is passed. Once the test is passed, you refactor the code (clean it up by removing redundancies, etc) and move on to the next piece of code.
	@Test
	Test Case
		This is how each individual test it's call. In JUnit this is implemented as methods annotated with the @Test annotation. The methods return void and are grouped togather unde a parent class.
	@TestPlan
	Test Fixture
		Is the sourrounding class around the test cases. It's responsible for setting things up that are needed for each test.
	Test Runner
		Finds and runs all the test ceses that tou specify. When it completes, it provides you with the results of how many tests passed and how many test failed.
	AAA
		Arrange -> Act -> Assert
	The happy path
		You should be able to determine what that path is by asking yourself this question. If this code ran correctly, how would I know?
	abstract
		This keyword mean that the class can't be instantiated.
	abstract method
		This is an empty method the that is declared in a abstract class but needs to be overrite in the class that implement it.
	extends vs implements 
		Extends is for when you're inheriting from a base class (i.e. extending its functionality).
		Implements is for when you're implementing an interface.
	interface vs abstract class
		An abstract class can have shared state or functionality. An interface is only a promise to provide the state or functionality. A good abstract class will reduce the amount of code that has to be rewritten because it's functionality or state can be shared. The interface has no defined information to be shared.
		Differences:
			- Abstract class can extend only one class or one abstract class at a time. Interface can extend any number of interfaces at a time.
			- Abstract  class  can extend from a class or from an abstract class. Interface can extend only from an interface.
			- Abstract  class  can  have  both  abstract and concrete methods. Interface can  have only abstract methods.
			- Class can extend only one abstract class. A class can implement any number of interfaces.
			- In abstract class keyword ‘abstract’ is mandatory to declare a method as an abstract. In an interface keyword ‘abstract’ is optional to declare a method as an abstract.
			- Abstract  class can have  protected , public and public abstract methods. Interface can have only public abstract methods i.e. by default.
			- Abstract class can have  static, final  or static final  variable with any access specifier	 interface  can  have only static final (constant) variable i.e. by default.
	Inner class
		Inner classes are helpful sometimes to create classes that depend on certain variables in a surrounding class, or parent class. This type of classes are ussualy protected. Example: Map.Entry 
	Test rule "FIRST"
		Fast - Isolated - Repeatable - Self-verifying - Timely.
	Test rule "CORRECT"
		Conform - Ordering - Range - Reference - Existence - Cardinality - Time.
			C - What happens when the unit receives data that doesn’t Conform to the expected format?
			O - Is the Ordering of values returned in the expected order. Applications where listing results in a certain sort order is important, should definitely have tests proving that this works as intended.
			R - Make sure that you check the Range. What happens if you go below the minimum or over the maximum value allowed?
			R - Does this unit Reference any other code from another unit? Is that other code unit tested?
			E - Remember that Existence is important in most units. Are things allowed to be null? What happens if they are?
			C - You should check the different possible number of elements in a grouping, or Cardinality. Related to existence, always check what happens when there are 0. What happens with a single value, what happens with multiple values. This is often called 0-1-n, because none, one and some usually produce different expectations.
			T - Remember to always take Time into account. This can be relative as well as absolute. Like for instance, sometimes applications require things to happen in a certain order. What happens if it doesn’t?
	fail()
		JUnit method to force a test to fail.
	assertEquals()
		This method throws an error if the variables are not equals. Example: assertEquals(message, expected, actual)
	assertNull()
		This method throws an error if the variables are not null. Example: assertEquals(message, variable)
	@Before
		The before annotation ia use for the setUp method (setUp name is optional), this way we can set the necessary requirements for each test without repeat a the same code.
	@After
		The method under this annotation will run after each of the test method completes. (TearDown method)
	@Rule
	ExpectedException
		Allow you to redefube behavior in each test method. With this annotation we can specify the kind of exception we are expecting base on the message.
	Test doubles
		Fake
			Have working inplementations. Use shortcuts. In memory databases are a great example.
		Stubs
			Respond with a canned answer. Avoid having to do heavy calculations. Can ve used to avoid network connectivity.
		Third party libraries
		Spies
			Fancier stubs. Can be used to verify things happened in a certain order.
		Mocks
			From a specification od expected calls. Throws exceptions when used incorrectly. 
	Constructor dependency injection
		Allows you to easily switch out implementations as needed, and it's super-handy for test doubles.
	Continuous integration CI
		A development practice where developers check-in code and have automated tests and automatic builds that help detect problems early.
		Continuous Integration requires developers to merge code into a shared repository several times a day. And what that does is it helps detect build problems and it helps developers find errors easily by exposing them. Now if you commit infrequently it makes error handling much more troublesome. If you wait until you get ready to launch the product to see how integration is working, it's bound to cause a delay.
	Popular CI Solutions
		Travis CI
		CircleCI
		Bamboo
		Codeship
		Jenkins
	TIP:
		If you import static [reverseDNS] you can call the methods without call the class. Example: fail() instead Assert.fail().
		Add to the README file a build status (Status Image: Markdown) so anybody can see that the code is working safely.
		Double-sided relationship:
			protected Answer(Question question, User author, String text) {
		        super(author, text);
		        this.question = question;
		        question.addAnswer(this); // Double-sided relationship
			}
Example: Example12.java
	Dependency
		Whenever a class A uses another class or interface B, then A depends on B. A cannot carry out it's work without B, and A cannot be reused without also reusing B. In such a situation the class A is called the "dependant" and the class or interface B is called the "dependency". A dependant depends on its dependencies.
	Transitive dependency
		When a dependency that you are using requires another library, the required library is known as a transitive dependency. Essentially, what this means to you is that you also rely on that other dependency.
	Gradle
		Is an amazingly flexible build tool, and it's jam packed with all sorts of features. Build tools are used to automate the process of packaging up and shipping your code to your users.
	TIP
		To add a new dependency you can browse through http://commons.apache.org/ and take the info of the dependency to add it in build.gradle
		When search in maven for a repository google can offer better results than maven website. Example: Search in google -> maven html parser
	Maven central
		Place were the required repositories are downloaded throught gradle. It can be modify or substituted in build.gradle
	./gradlew
		Console command to get gradlew install in the computer.
	./gradlew dependencies
		Show list of dependencies for the different configurations.
	Semantic versioning (sim ver)
		v2.5.1
			v2 - Major version: Use when you make API changes that are not compatible with prior releases.
			5 - Minor version: Use when you add funcionality in a backwards compatible manner.
			1 - The patch: When you add bug fixes.
		Sometimes the word SNAPSHOT is added to the end to signify the latest development version, prior to a release. It's for code that's under development, but not yet released.
	Functional programming
		In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
	SAM
		Single abstract method.
	Lamba
		Unname anonymous function.
Example: Example13.java
	Web Server
		Frameworks either embed or integrate with a specific web server. This is what handles the actual communication over HTTP. It makes sure it can handle many requests at once and serve multiple clients.
	Routing
		An HTTP request specifies the resource it wants through headers. A framework allows developers to define what code gets run based on the resource requested. They usually allow you to partially match the URI to keep things dynamic.
	Request and Response objects
		Frameworks usually give you a very rich request and response object that are representations of the HTTP requests and responses. These objects make it very easy for you to check if a header exists or handle normal HTTP status codes.
	Templating
		Most pages have a surrounding style and only little bits of dynamic data. Instead of writing all those bits in a string, the idea of templating is used. Most frameworks allow you to snap in different templating languages to build pages and push in just the dynamic bits into the surrounding HTML.
	Data Access Object (DAO)
		This is a desing pattern that's used to abstract a wayy how you retrieve and store data.
	Template reuse or template inheritance.
		It means the ability to embed part of a template into another one.
	Handlebars
		Create html structure 
			html:5 + tab
		We have a base html format and we only neet to change a specific block, we use:
			{{#block "placeholder"}}{{/block}}
			{{#partial "placeholder"}}{{/partial}}
			{{> base.hbs}}
		Create css link
			link:css + tab
	Spark
		get()
			HTTP method in spatk, it takes a path to match the HTML forms.
		post()
			HTTP method in spatk, it takes a path to match the HTML forms.
		staticFileLocation("/public")
			Anything that can't be found will look into this public directory first. Static files are files that don't change or don't need any dynamic implementation.
		before()
			Spark filter (HTTP middleware), it's executed even before the request is proccess, it takes a path to match the HTML forms.
		halt()
			Stop the request form hitting any of the other routes. Commonly use inside the before block.
		findFirst()
			Method use after a stream().filter(). It allow you to get the first item that match the filter. After use this method you have to give an option in case of any of the items match the filter, using the methods orElse*().
			Example: ideas.stream().filter(courseIdea -> courseIdea.getTitle().equals(slug)).findFirst().orElseThrow(NotFoundException::new);
		queryParam()
			Get a value submitted on the URL or through the form.
			Example: /smartapp/getDataViewModelConfig?collId=123
				String id = request.queryParams("collId");
		param()
			Get a parameter off of the request taking whatever was in the URL.
			Example: post("/ideas/:slug/vote", ...;
				dao.findBySlug(request.params("slug"));
		cookie()
			Allows you to access a cookie.
			Example: response.cookie("username", username);
		attribute()
			Use to set and get a specific value.
			Example: request.attribute("username", request.cookie("username"));
				model.put("username", request.attribute("username"));
		exception()
			method use to catch an exception, and redirect to a page. return is not necessary from this exception handler.
			Example:
				exception(NotFoundException.class, (exception, request, response) -> {
		            response.status(404);
		            HandlebarsTemplateEngine engine = new HandlebarsTemplateEngine();
		            String html = engine.render(new ModelAndView(null, "not-found.hbs"));
		            response.body(html);
		        } );
		session()
			Pocket that allows you to save information. 
			Example: request.session().attribute(FLASH_MESSAGE_KEY);
				session().removeAttribute(FLASH_MESSAGE_KEY);
	POJO 
		Plain Old Java Object
	HTTP middleware
		A request comes in, and the framework first looks for any handler that should run before the request is processed. This handler has access to request and response, and it can add or change things, including stopping the request altogether. If things are to continue, the request is handled using the proper methods. Finally, any matching after-methods are run. Now this pattern is pretty powerful for things like authentication, like logging into a site with a username or a password.
Example: Example14.java
	Java versatility
		Java has an extensive presence on platforms of all types. These include mobile devices, enterprise systems like in banks or hospitals, or gadgets such as refrigerators or arduinos.
	@Override
		This annotation in Java instructs the compiler to verify proper inheritance. Specifically, it verifies proper overriding of methods. 
	@Deprecated
		This annotation allows us to mark methods, classes, and fields for future deletion, giving other developers a compiler message to update their code.
	@SuppressWarnings
		Deal with warnings that java compiler produce.
	Especify directory for .class
		Example to compile: javac -d out -cp src src/com/treehouse/override/Main.java
		Example to run: java -cp out com/treehouse/override/Main.java
	Xlint
		Allow us to know not only the errors but the warnings.
		Example: javac -Xlint -d out -cp src src/com/treehouse/override/Main.java
